# Hi there, I'm Surya! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a web and mobile app developer at **Stratforge**, where I work as a full-time Frontend Engineer. I specialize in Flutter, React, Next.js, React Native, Express, and Node.js. React is my forte, but Iâ€™m also diving into creating visually appealing UI designs with a keen eye for detail. Iâ€™m coding like my life depends on itâ€”because it does, and itâ€™s a lot of fun!
